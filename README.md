Auto-accepts [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) permission prompts so you can go get donuts.

## What it does

- Scans all Terminal.app windows/tabs for Claude permission prompts
- Reads the actual options to determine if "2" means "Allow all" or "Type here" (reject)
- Presses the right key (1 for yes, 2 for allow-all when available)
- Tracks prompts by hash so it won't spam the same one twice

## Usage

```bash
# Download
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bliu-msg/drinking-bird/main/drinking_bird.sh
chmod +x drinking_bird.sh

# Run in a separate terminal
./drinking_bird.sh
```

## Requirements

- macOS (uses AppleScript to read Terminal.app)
- Terminal.app (not iTerm2 - PRs welcome!)
- Claude Code CLI

## Output

```
🐦 DRINKING BIRD activated

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. This is like putting a drinking bird on your keyboard - convenient but maybe don't leave it running while `rm -rf` commands are flying around.

## License

MIT - Do whatever you want, just don't blame me when Claude deletes your production database.
